<h1> Rory McIlroy </h1>

<h2> Is he one of the most hated Irish golfers ever? </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<body><i> Rory Daniel McIlroy </i> MBE is a Northern Irish professional golfer who is a member of both the European Tour and the PGA Tour. He is former world number one in the Official World Golf Ranking, and has spent over a hundred weeks in that position during his career.<br> but I think that people hate on him way too much </br>
<h3>High Expectations:</h3> McIlroy has been considered one of the best golfers of his generation, and with success comes high expectations. When he doesn't meet those expectations—such as failing to win more majors after a fast start early in his career—criticism often follows.
